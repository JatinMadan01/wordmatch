Word Connect Game
The Word Connect Game is an interactive and customizable React-based word-matching game. Players match pairs of related words, get visual feedback on their selections, and can track their attempts. The game also includes a configuration panel to adjust gameplay settings such as group size, number of items, and grid layout.
